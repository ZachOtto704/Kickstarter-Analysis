# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Overview of Project: The client, Louise, wants to start a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in order to help fund her play, "Fever". She estimates a budget of $10,000 and wants to find more information about how to best structure her campaign. We helped Louise by organizing, sorting, and analyzing data from campaigns similar to hers.
Analysis and Challenges: In order to help Louise, we began by running an analysis of other theatrical play campaigns. We started by comparing the goal statistics (amount of money aimed to be raised) with outcome statistics (whether the campaign succeeded in reaching its goal, failed, or was canceled). Attached below as "Outcomes_vs_Goals.png", you can see the analysis we ran. Second, we analyzed the outcome (again, whether the campaign succeeded in reaching its goal, failed, or was canceled)of other theater campaigns with data of when, specifically, which months of the year, the campaigns launched. You can see a description of our findings below as "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch".

Results of Theater Outcomes v Launch Date: In looking at the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date analysis, two conclusions can be made. First, the most successful theater campaigns were launched in the months of Aptil-July, with May being the most successful month. With this, Louise should aim to launch her campaign somewhere in these months, with May being the absolute best month to launch. Second, the least successful months to launch theater campaigns were in October-January. October was the month that held the most launches of campaigns that eventually failed. And December held the least amount of launches the eventually succeeded in meeting their goal. With this information, Louise, should avoid launching her campaign during these months.
Results of Outcomes v Goal: In looking at the Theater campaign outcomes by goal analysis, it is clear that campaigns that have lesser capital goals are more successful than campaigns that have higher capital goals. This seems intuative as the more money desired to raise, the harder it will be. However, one conclusion we can make out of this data is that the halfway point of the data is in the $15,000-$19,999 range. This means that campaigns past this mark will be more than 50% likely to fail. While campaigns before this mark will be more than 50% likely to succeed. 
Summary of limitations: It would be a good idea to look at launch outcomes tailored to Louise's $10,000 funding goal, as well as her play being in the US. I would recommend looking at launch date data for theatrical play campaigns in the US with a funding goal of $5,000-$15,000.
